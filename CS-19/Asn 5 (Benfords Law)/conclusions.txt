Benford's law holds true for most of these data sets.
The distribution of first digit is very close to the law log(1 + 1/d) where d is the digit in question.
Expected frequencies of each first digit according to the law:
1: 30.1%
2: 17.6%
3: 12.5%
4: 9.6%
5: 7.9%
6: 6.7%
7: 5.8%
8: 5.1%
9: 4.5%

The data sets that illustrated this the best was the library and sunspots data.
