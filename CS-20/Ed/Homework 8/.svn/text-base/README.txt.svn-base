Extra Credit: 
- Undo.
- Unlimited shapes.
- MouseHandler in PaintApp is an inner class.
- Cool extra pane for controls.

Note: The controls pane looks dandy on Mac OS X. I have no idea how it looks on XP, however I guess that the large title bar buttons will cover up the word controls. And maybe the actual buttons wont be in a perfect column.
